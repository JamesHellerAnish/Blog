            <p><b>Budding entrepreneurs sometimes tend to understand the effort necessary to start a venture, but they are most of the times not even familiar with the many steps required to launch a business/venture.</b></p>
            <p>If you're willing to put it all in to build your venture, you're going to want to know the steps required. So, here we present the seven key steps that we think you should need to take to start your own business. Also, always remember to be flexible as every venture is unique.
            
            <ol>
            <li>    
            <p><b>Try and conduct a personal questionnaire:</b></p>
            <p>You need to ask yourself a few questions to start off your venture. Questions like:</p>
            <p>Why do you want to start a venture? </p>
            <p>Do you have the necessary skills?</p>
            <p>What industries do you have knowledge about?</p>
            <p>Do you wish to start a service or a product?</p>
            <p>Will you take it as a full-time or a part-time venture?</p>
            <p>Your answers to these questions will help you focus on your venture in a proper way.</p>
            <p>Answering these questions may or may not be able to ensure you’re a success, but it will make you think about your goals and about what motivates and inspires you.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <p><b>Analyze your field and industry:</b></p>
            <p>Once you decide on a venture, evaluate and analyze your idea. Question yourself and try to find answers about who will be your customers and who your competitors? You also need to figure out your financial requirements and how much money you will need to get started.</p>
            <p>There are n number of ways to research about your market, which includes performing Google searches or trying to speak to people already working in your industry, gaining knowledge through books written by people from your industry, researching key people, reading relevant news sites and industry magazines and if required even attending classes.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <p><b>Evaluate your target audience:</b></p>
            <p>To determine how attractive your venture might be you should always do a market analysis. It will guide your research as you think about the following few questions:</p>
            <p>What’s the market size that you are targeting? Have you figured it out who exactly your target market is? Being specific about these will help you focus your marketing message and investment.</p>
            <p>You need to determine how much money and effort it might cost to deliver the value you would like to be offering? How long will your product take to get to market? How much up-front investment you will be requiring before you can begin with your venture?</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <p><b>Officiate your business:</b></p>
            <p>Registering your venture is the first step realistically towards making it real.</p>
            <p>If it's possible you should work with a lawyer to figure out all the details while registering your venture. This is not a field you can risk to be wrong at. You will also need to be issued proper business licenses and permits. During this time you will also require checking into insurance and finding a good accountant.</p>
            You should try and spend some time getting to know the pros and cons of each business formation and then decide what kind of business formation is suitable for you and your venture.</p>
            </li>
            </ol>

            <ol start= "5">
                <li>
                <p><b>Start the planning process:</b></p>
                <p>Having a business plan is a must. A business plan helps one figure out how much money one needs to start, what will make one's business profitable and where is the venture headed.</p>
                <p>A business plan acts as a roadmap—something you will use to help you map your progress and that will outline the things you need to do in order to reach your goals. Think of it as a tool to manage how your business grows and achieves its goals rather than thinking of it as a hefty document that you’ll only use once or twice.</p>
                <p>A business plan is mainly used to define one's strategy, tactics, and key activities for execution, including the milestones, deadlines, budgets and cash flow.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <p><b>Plan your funding:</b></p>
                <p>Depending upon your venture and your goals, you may or may not need to seek funding from an investor for you may be able to fund it yourself. Hence you should be sure about this before starting your venture because it constitutes an important part.</p>
                <p>A beautiful business plan may not guarantee you with funding but a pitch does. To stand a realistic chance of raising funds you need to get started and you should first focus completely on your pitch. Also if you have a perfect pitch ready you can always turn it into a business plan but you cannot do the opposite with a business plan. Hence having a solid pitch becomes a necessity.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <p><b>Be ready for trial and error:</b></p>
                <p>No matter how much experience you have you are still bound to make mistakes. This is a natural process and it also quite beneficial if you are able to learn from them.</p>
                <p>Even after taking all these steps and ensuring that you have prepared thoroughly before starting your venture you should accept and realize that things will almost certainly go awry. To run a successful business, you must adapt to changing situations and like the above seven steps should remember and understand these seven important things.</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>
                <p><b>Believe in Yourself :</b></p>
                <p>Others will only believe in you if you trust and believe in yourself and the idea.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <p><b>Bad decisions are not always bad :</b></p>
                <p>One should always learn from their decisions good or bad.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                <p><b>Prioritize customers over anything else: </b></p>
                <p>If your customers are happy and satisfied then your growth is bound to happen and success will touch your feet.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <p><b>Be open to Suggestions:</b></p>
                <p>No matter what you should always be open to suggestions as a good idea can come from anyone.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <p><b>Trust Your Team:</b></p>
                <p>You are going to spend most of your productive time with your team. They are your second family.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <p><b>Take care of yourself:</b></p>
                <p>Your team needs healthy leadership and it's your responsibility to ensure that.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                <p><b>Conducting in-depth market research about your field: </b></p>
                <p>This research involves surveys, holding focus groups, and researching SEO and public data.</p>
                <li>
            </ul>
                </li>
