            <h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dance has been a part of human culture since the very earliest civilisations, as the humans evolved the dance form has also evolved and passed down from generation to generation.</span>
                <p>&nbsp;</p></h4>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the humans evolved the dance form has also evolved with them and passed down from generation to generation. Dance form displays the tradition, culture and symbolism. Initially, the dances are performed during ceremonies only but slowly we adapted this dance form to our social gatherings also. Now the meaning and styles of dancing have changed, there are two distinct forms of dance- </span><strong>social</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong>theatrical</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Participatory dance also known</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as Social dance&nbsp;is where dancing in a group or groups is encouraged. These type of dances are most commonly found at weddings, social gatherings, and festivals, and they can be enjoyed with folk music both alone or in a group. Whereas theatrical dance is where dancers perform on a stage in front of an audience. It can also be a solo as well as group performance.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the early days, different dances have changed, merged and evolved into what we know today as the most well-known dance genres. Dance styles have many different forms, each form with its own set of techniques or skills, music and style. It is taken into practice by many dancers to start out taking several&nbsp;different dance classes, learning an overview of a handful of types of dance before specializing in one area, as they get older.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><strong>Contemporary Dance:</strong></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contemporary dance was developed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the mid-twentieth century and since that time it has grown to become one of the dominant genres of dance performances for formally trained dancers throughout the world. It is a highly complicated type of performance dance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Contemporary dance is all about connecting the mind and the body through its complicated dance movements. It is typically done barefoot.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Although the elements in this dance form is incorporated from ballet, jazz, modern, lyrical and various different dance styles it is different from all those techniques. In terms of its technique, contemporary dance usually tends to combine the strong but controlled legwork of ballet, it also stresses on torso which is incorporated from modern style. It also includes floor work, fall and recovery, contract- release, and improvisation characteristics of modern dance. Most of the times contemporary dance&nbsp; incorporates elements of non-western dance cultures, such as bent knees which is taken from African dance form. It also incorporates movements from Butoh which is the Japanese contemporary dance. Also it&rsquo;s focus on unpredictability, non-standardized costumes, disordered choreography, multiple and simultaneous actions, improvisation, and sets and lighting has pushed this dance form into the forefront of modern art dance scene.</span></p>

Ballets are classified as, classical ballet, neoclassical ballet, romantic ballet and contemporary ballet. As it relies heavily on&nbsp;technique, an enormous amount of diligence and dedication is required to perfect it. Ballet is typically danced to classical music and is done wearing slippers or pointed shoes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are six widely used, methods to teach or study ballet. These methods are the&nbsp;</span><strong>French</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> School, </span><strong>the</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><strong>Cecchetti</strong> <strong>Method</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><strong>the</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><strong>Royal</strong> <strong>Academy</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Dance method&nbsp;(English style), the&nbsp;</span><strong>Vaganova</strong> <strong>Method</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the&nbsp;</span><strong>Bournonville</strong> <strong>method</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the&nbsp;</span><strong>Balanchine</strong> <strong>method</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;(American style).
