                <h4><b>How to self-quarantine at home.</b> </h4>
              
                <p>Health authorities aka corona warriors are requesting more and more people to self-quarantine or self-isolate in order to contain the spread of COVID-19.</p>

                <p>Also if you're a parent or caretaker of elderly parents, it’s quite normal that you might find yourself feeling overwhelmed just at the thought of these measures. These words may tend you to imagine sci-fi images of hazmat suits or cushioned solitary cells but the reality is less terrifying. Here’s what you need to know if you or someone you know has been told to self-quarantine.</p>
 
                <b>What’s the difference between quarantine and isolation?</b>
                <p>According to the CDC (Centre for Disease Control), quarantines’ sole purpose are meant to restrict the movement of people who may have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick in the foreseeable future. These individuals are asymptomatic but they either have travelled to an area with an active outbreak of the said virus, or have had close contact with a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19.</p>
                <p>Isolation, meanwhile, refers to separating those who are already sick from the rest of the population to prevent them from being infected from the virus. Self-isolation basically aim at providing individuals with the opportunity to recover from the virus without spreading and infecting it to others.</p>
                <b>Why self-quarantine?</b>
                <p>Even if you’re doing everything in the right way, like washing your hands and practicing social distancing. You may still find yourself in a situation where you're concerned about the fact that you've been exposed to coronavirus (COVID-19). You don’t feel sick or have symptoms, but maybe you work in the same office as someone who is a confirmed COVID-19 case, attended a party or large gathering where someone was later confirmed to be positive for COVID-19 or travelled in an airplane seated next to someone who was coughing. Understandably, you're concerned. An epidemic is considered to be a good time to be on high alert, but self-quarantining is only necessary if you and your family are reasonably suspicious that you're infected with the virus or came in contact. Public health officials are always there to help you decide what you should do. Since quarantining yourself can be disruptive to your personal and professional life, the decision to self-quarantine isn't one to make without knowing the facts. If you are self-quarantining yourself then here's what you need to know about how you should self-quarantine in the right way.</p>
                <b>How to self-quarantine</b>
                <p>Based on what's currently known about how long the symptoms might last, the recommended length of quarantine is 14 days. The main goal here is to prevent the potential spread of the virus by separating yourself from other people long enough to determine whether or not you're infected and showing the symptoms.</p>
                <h4><b>The CDC recommends taking the following steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19:</b></h4>
                <b>Stay Home</b>
                <p>Out-of-home activity should be limited only to medical care and emergencies. Refrain from going to school or work. You should also avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, and taxis. If you need groceries, try using a meal or grocery delivery service where your food can be dropped off right outside your door. Hence, don't leave your house unless absolutely necessary.</p>
 
                <b>Separate yourself from the people you share your home with</b>
                <p>The CDC recommends keeping to one room as much as possible if you live with roommates or family members. You should try and use a separate bathroom if possible or else sanitize it properly as per the WHO or CDC guidelines/recommendations.</p>
                <b>Wash your hands often</b>
                <p>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and if soap and water aren’t available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. By practicing proper hand hygiene one can help prevent the spread of the virus. Always wash your hands after blowing your nose, sneezing or coughing. In addition, avoid touching your face.</p>


            <p class="mb-5">
              <img src="images/image_2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            
            <b>Wear a mask</b>
            <p>If you are sick and must go in public or be around other people, it’s important to wear a face mask to prevent spreading the virus. Remember to also put a face-mask on before entering the doctor’s office or when traveling to and from your doctor’s appointments.</p>
 
            <b>Don't share your stuff</b>
            <p>To avoid spreading germs avoid sharing the following items with people or animals in your home:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Bedding</li>
            <li>Dishes, drinking glasses and utensils</li>
            <li>Towels, including hand towels in the kitchen and bathroom</li>
            </ul>

             <p>Also after using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
 
            <b>Disinfect commonly touched surfaces every day</b>
            <p>Early evidence shows that the new coronavirus can live on surfaces — for hours or even days in some cases.</p>
            <p>Make sure to clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces around your home at least once per day, including:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Bathroom fixtures</li>
            <li>Counters</li>
            <li>Door knobs</li>
            <li>Keyboards</li>
            <li>Phones</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Exercise</b>
            <p>Staying active will keep you not only mentally but also physically healthy during your quarantine period. Exercise cannot only help you reduce your elevated cortisol levels but will trigger the release of endorphins which in return will be boosting your overall mood and happiness also. If you are feeling well enough and don’t have active symptoms, try an in-home workout to avoid physical contact with others. Even walking up a few flights of stairs, or having a solo dance party in your room can prove to be helpful.</p>

            <b>Stay in contact with friends and family</b>
            <p>Even if you are self-quarantined you should your best to connect with your friends and family through video chats or phone calls. Studies show that quality time with people you care about can boost your happiness level.</p>
            <b>Monitor your symptoms</b>
            <p>Check for your fever twice a day using your personal thermometer. Also, take a note if you're experiencing spike in your temperature or beginning to cough or experiencing shortness of breath.</p>
            <p>You may or may not experience COVID-19 symptoms (coughing, fever and shortness of breath) during your quarantine. If you do begin experiencing symptoms:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Always wear the recommended mask by WHO when you're around people or using common spaces in your home</li>
            <li>Cover your coughs and sneezes and immediately wash your hands afterward</li>
            <li>Contact your health care provider or use telemedicine to seek guidance from home</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Use telemedicine or call ahead before seeing your doctor</b>
            <p>If you are beginning to experience the above mentioned symptoms and/or need medical advice from a health care provider, consider trying telemedicine first. If you need to go to your doctor's office, let your care team know ahead of time that you may have COVID-19. This will help the team take the precautionary steps needed to protect other people from being exposed to the virus.</p>
            <p>By carefully following these tips, along with guidance from the CDC and various public health officials, you can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect your friends and loved ones, as well as those most at risk of severe infection.</p>
