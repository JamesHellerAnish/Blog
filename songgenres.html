Almost all the time these categories overlap and it give rise to various controversies. Each song has its own style and form. Some songs can have same style but they can be of different forms or some can have same forms but they can be of different styles. The genres and sub genres can be categorised based on these styles and forms. Origin of the music plays a very important role in categorising a genre, the origin may be geographical or some traditional context like music that came into picture during renaissance period. Music can also be categorised by the musical techniques, content and the cultural context. People listen to or like similar songs (same style or form) of different genres this can be explained by the three dimensions of arousal, valence and depth.

Arousal refers to physiological processes such as stimulation and relaxation (intense, forceful, abrasive, thrilling vs. gentle, calming, mellow), valence refers to emotion and mood processes (fun, happy, lively, enthusiastic, joyful vs. depressing, sad), and depth refers to cognitive processes (intelligent, sophisticated, inspiring, complex, poetic, deep, emotional, thoughtful vs. party music, danceable).</span></p>
