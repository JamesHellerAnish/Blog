            <h4><strong>Once this lockdown is over, we all will be craving to go out, to travel, to go on a trip or a vacation with our family or our friends. But planning a vacation can sometimes be expensive and since the economy is also down due to the huge impact of COVID-19, you would certainly like to spend minimal on your trip and budget and plan it properly.</strong></h4>
            <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, here we are with some of our suggestions on how to plan a trip and to fit your trip in your wallet. Travelling your trip strategically is the key to make the most of your money and though you may not be able to reduce some of your costs due to your travelling expenses or expenditures but still there are various ways to plan a maximum enjoyable trip on a minimal budget. That&rsquo;s where travel budget comes into the picture as it not only helps you to plan your trip better but also provides with a stress-free holiday to enjoy. A travel budget should be considered as a guide and not a set of rules that one should follow i.e., a travel budget is always flexible. </span><strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong>
            <ol start="1">
            <li><strong>Decide your destination</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out a destination you are going to for a holiday is one of the crucial aspects of planning your trip as you need to ensure that just the journey to your destination may not make your trip out of budget. Especially when you are going far from home because that will cost you expensive air fare. The destination you and your folks choose and the duration of your stay decides the major cost of your trip.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step you can take in this direction is to sit with your folks and decide what are your plans and what would you like to do on your trip post this lockdown. According to all the wishes and the choices you need to narrow down the places and then choose a place which satisfies maximum no. of people and is in your budget. Also you should remember that you should try and avoid travelling in peak seasons as the costs are quite high at that time. Hence wait for the season when market is down so as to a comfortable and cheap trip. A trip in a low season will help you cover the maximum places you would want.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol start="2">
            <li><strong>Compare travel packages</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After deciding your destination your next step should be to search which company is offering the best travel packages or the best tour fare or the best hotel (because your accommodation constitutes a big chunk of your budget) in a low or minimal budget range. Surf the Internet, visit sites like Trivago and MakeMyTrip or call up travel agencies to do an extensive comparative study before you choose anything. Even various online travel data repositories such as Wego.com, Expedia.co.in and Kayak.co.in are present which can give you a fair idea about the best bargains available. Another good way to get the best bargain is to approach the local travel agents and get some idea of what type of packages are being promoted in this season. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also go for group tours. It won&rsquo;t let you enjoy your holiday at your own pace but then group tours are much more cost-effective. Since you can now cover more places in less time and take care of all expenses like accommodation, food, transfers and transportation at a lesser cost.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span>
            <ol start="3">
            <li><strong>Research your destination</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a travel package is good but sometimes this also not helps. Knowing your destination before-hand is always helpful. So if you have time you should research and plan your own trip. This could even prove to be a lot of fun.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another advantage of knowing about the place you are visiting is that you can give make your own itinerary. One more way to save your money is making early reservations to avail of the discounts and lock in prices to avoid getting saddened by fluctuating exchange rates.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /><br /></span></p>

                <img src="images/trip.jpg" alt="How to Maximise your trip
                with minimal budget" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <ol start="4">
                <li><strong>Make your money count more</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should try and search for travel discount sites so as to get good offers on holiday destinations and packages. Also book your air tickets early because of the dynamic pricing system and try to avail some discount on them through various online sites.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your stay, during hotel reservation try and look for hotels which are closer to the airport or railway station (depending on your mode of conveyance) to eliminate the various middle expenses like the taxi expenses. Also if comfort during trip is not what your desire then you should try and avoid renting a car and go for a good public transportation system.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel with family and friends as when in a group you can always book multiple passes to places of tourist attraction to get a price concession and also share the price cost.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span>
                    <ol start="5">
                    <li><strong>The food</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your package tour will usually take care of the key expenses such as accommodation, airfares, sight-seeing and airport transfers. Other than these, food is the only major cost which would make you have to reach for your pocket. Try and explore dining areas outside the main tourist spots to save some money as these are comparatively cheaper and will also give you a chance to explore the local cuisines. Google maps and sites such as Tripadvisor.com can help you by providing you with links of those restaurants and their menus to help you plan out a meal at an affordable price.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also have a backup plan in case you do not find a suitable place or the local food does not suit your taste buds.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <ol start="6">
                <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span> <strong>Proper packing</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you are done with the bookings and reservations and you have a nicely planned itinerary, it&rsquo;s time for the final step and that it is to pack your bags effectively and efficiently. Before you head towards your wardrobe or wrap the toiletries, make sure you have a list of all essential items so that you don&rsquo;t need to buy anything at your destination as it may cost more than usual. If you have planned for a foreign trip, apart from a valid passport, you will also require a tourist visa and also do not forget to check if there are some country guidelines on specific vaccinations you might have to take before your visit. Also keep some common drugs like painkillers and paracetamol pills in your first-aid kit for any emergency. Another important thing is your travel insurance which you may sometimes deliberately forget but there are times when it can actually save you from a loss and a lot of trouble.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <ol start="7">
                <li><strong>Prepare for emergency</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now have a plan and are prepared to face come what may. But what about things that we don&rsquo;t know of, the various unknown variables in our plan. For these unforeseen circumstances or emergencies we should always plan something. Starting with&nbsp;keeping aside some money for things that we may have forgotten to include in our budget, medical emergencies, extra expenses, or even an impromptu event you may be invited for, while you&rsquo;re on the road.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the last step of your travel budget and now you are all set to go and enjoy your trip.</span></p>
