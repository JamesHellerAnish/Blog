            <p><b>Have you ever pondered upon what exactly is entrepreneurship? </p>
              <p>Why people are fascinated with it so much that they decide to try and pursue it as a viable career option? </p>
              <p>To answer this we present you with our thoughts on what is entrepreneurship and why is it amazing.</b></p>

              <p>Entrepreneurship is basically the process of starting a business or businesses or organisation for social needs or self profit, taking on financial risks in the hope of profit.</p>
              <p>This is perhaps, the most bookish yet apt definition of entrepreneurship available in the digital realm yet the history of entrepreneurship transcends digital and physical realms.</p>
              <p>Entrepreneurship seems to be the buzz word for today’s generation. There has been a great increase in the number of people taking risk of starting a business activity of their own but why?</p>
              
              <p>Here is our 13 reasons why:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><b>It provides you with a sense of control:</b>
              <p>You will always have full control over your destiny. You will be able to call the shots and make the decisions that ultimately determine your success or failure. Once you have built an expertise on taking the right choices, you will be asked and followed by many. Nobody will ever get in the way of your vision.</p>
              <p>"Entrepreneurship is a way we take control of our lives in a tough economy."</p>
              <p>– Lori Greiner</p>

              </li>
              
              <li>
              <b>Entrepreneurs are innovators:</b>
              <p>Stop for a moment and think of all the new technology and ideas that have come to life over the past few years. Those were all once just a mere idea -- but kudos to amazing entrepreneurs who brought those ideas to life.</p>
               <p>“There are lots of bad reasons to start a company. But there’s only one good, legitimate reason, and I think you know what it is: it’s to change the world.”</p>
              <p>– Phil Libin, CEO Evernote</p>
              </li>

              <li>
              <b>You become a part of a family:</b>
              <p>The entrepreneurial culture is nearly sort of a huge family and you won’t realize it initially but you would never find a better group of individuals always willing to offer advice and help than fellow entrepreneurs.
              <p>"The fastest way to change yourself is to hang out with people who are already the way you want to be.”
              <p>– Reid Hoffman, co-founder LinkedIn</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>You build your own team:</b>
              <p>The team you surround yourself with plays a serious role in your success. You can assemble a team of like-minded individuals that share your same drive and fervour.</p>
              <p>“It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.”</p>
              <p>– Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO Berkshire Hathaway</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>You bring change:</b>
               <p>To make a change, to impact lives is all what we want. Have a plan or just an idea for a product or service that has the potential to form an enormous impact? opt for it because there is nothing stopping you.</p>
               <p>“ Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other’s opinions "</p>
              <p>– Steve Jobs, Co-founder, CEO, Chairman Apple Inc.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>You serve as a role model:</b>
              <p>As an entrepreneur, people will always look up to you for guidance and inspiration. You have the required ability and aura to be a role model for family, friends, employees and community members. Your success serves as motivation and inspiration to many who want to be an entrepreneur or have failed in being so.</p>
              <p>“Being a role model is the most powerful form of educating.”</p>
              <p>- John Wooden</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-5">
              <img src="images/image_2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <ul>

            <li>
            <b>There is no age barrier</b>
            <p>Entrepreneurs nowadays are starting at very young and unexpected ages, some straight out of college, some while still in high school and even children as young as 9 years old but this does not mean that the older ones are late to start. People in their 60s have also pursued this just like colonel sanders, founder of KFC. This is the beauty, the privilege that entrepreneurship offers.</p>
            <p>“Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.”</p>
            <p>– Mark Twain</p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <b>Your mind will always be utilized</b>
            <p>No matter what, no matter how much you try to avoid it. Every single decision that involves your business or start-up is your responsibility, from the initial concept and branding to the growth of your business or start-up and goal setting. You will always be in a state of thinking and improvising.</p>
            <p>“As long as you’re going to be thinking anyway, think big.”</p>
            <p>-Donald Trump</p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <b>Sense of belongingness and ownership</b>
            <p>It is a great feeling to be able to step back and say, “this is my company,” while proudly holding your head up. Being an entrepreneur always involves an incredible amount of work without rest -- those few words feel so good coming out of your mouth. </p>
            <p>“When I’m old and dying, I plan to look back on my life and say ‘wow, that was an adventure,’ not ‘wow, I sure felt safe.’”</p>
            <p>– Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder Github</p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <b>You can always go cubicle free</b>
            <p>Being entrepreneurs you have total freedom to roam, create, delegate and work. There are no cubicles or desks to be tied to all day. You have the freedom that others always desire of.</p>
            <p>“Choose a job that you like, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”</p>
            <p>- Confucius</p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <b>You are the one incharge</b>
            <p>If you have any ideas or plans to make the business or the start-up better then you can implement them right away. You don’t have to hope that someone placed in a higher position than yours will give you the time of day and listen to your suggestions. </p>
            <p>“Don’t be afraid to assert yourself, have confidence in your abilities and don’t let the bastards get you down.”</p>
            <p>– Michael Bloomberg, founder Bloomberg L.P. </p>
            </li>

          <li>
            <b>Entrepreneurship allows you to follow passion</b>
            <p>You try and flip your passion and beliefs into a business or a start-up by providing you with the appropriate platform. If you are passionate about health and fitness you can start a career as a nutritional consultant or try an open a gym. You have this huge opportunity and ability to create a business as well as be able to impact folks through your passions and beliefs. 
            <p>“I knew that if I failed I wouldn’t regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not trying.”</p>
            <p>-Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO Amazon</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>You learn from firsthand experience</b>
            <p>You learn from your experiences and decisions. As a budding entrepreneur, you are perpetually learning lessons though sometimes it's the hard way. Regardless of that, it's a valuable education that you can never get in a classroom.</p>
            <p>“Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.”</p>
            <p>-Bill Gates, founder and CEO Microsoft</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
