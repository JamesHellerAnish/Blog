            <ol>
            <li>
            <b>Cloud computing</b>
            <p>Amazon AWS one of the leaders of cloud computing defines cloud computing as,cloud computing is one of the most on-demand deliveries of IT resources over the Internet which has a pay-as-you-go pricing system. With the use of it, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centres and servers.</p>
            <p>Each and every Organization rather small, big or industries are shifting to clouds for their day to day operations from data backup to real-time fraud detection and prevention and everything in between. So getting into the cloud is very beneficial now to grow your career or to start it as a beginner. If you go pay wise it is one of the highest-paid jobs in the IT sector according to data in 2019. You must have certifications on various cloud computing features ranges from developing the cloud until the security and architecture. You can do Microsoft certifications for better job opportunities in this sector.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <b>Cybersecurity</b>
            <p>As the name suggests it deals with security of systems, servers over the internet or in an organisation. As the internet grows the threat from it to the individual as well as the organisation grows exponentially. Companies are hiring cybersecurity professional at a higher wage as there is more demand for this sector than supply. Not anyone can become a cybersecurity expert. One should have a mindset, dedication to becoming one. And once you are there no one can stop you from achieving success in this field.</p>

            <ol start = "3">
            <li>
            <b>Blockchain</b>
            <p>Blockchain was born in 2009 in order to support the use of cryptocurrency. It is a simple but ingenious way of passing information from point A to point B. The transfer of information is transparent, automated and safe. It is mostly used by banks, financial sectors, etc. Blockchain is beneficial for the financial sectors to safely authorize and transfer digital assets. Blockchainâ€™s unique way to store, validate, authorize and shift data across the internet has evolved to securely store and send any digital asset. The infrastructure cost of blockchain is high but there is no transaction cost. Every instance of a block is verified by millions of computers or nodes so falsifying data in a blockchain means falsifying the whole chain. It has a vast future. There is a small supply of professionals who have this skill set and they are in high demand. So learning this skill is a career booster.</p>
            <p>Coursera offers the course on blockchain. There are 20+ certifications available on the blockchain.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <b>AI and machine learning</b>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) augments the capabilities of the human workforce. With the rapid shift of industries to cloud platforms, it is mandatory for programmers or developers to also shift to a platform which will help them to easily migrate to the cloud-based platforms and they can do that by automating the process with the help of AI and machine learning. The people who can harness the power of AI, machine learning and natural language processing are the ones who will help organizations deliver more relevant, personalized, and innovative products and services.</p>
            <p>The list we have given above is not a top list of skills. It is just a tip of the iceberg, just a shortlist to get you started on the skills. When you dive down in any of the topics mentioned above you will know what a vast ocean it is. In cloud computing, there are 8 different certifications which are further divided into 3 different levels- beginner, intermediate and advanced. So if you are a fresher you have a long way to go but remember that with every certification you will learn and grow. You can consider learning any skill you think would be better for your resume or career and which comes under your forte.</p>
            <p>There are many websites that provide resources and will help you learn these skills from beginner to expert level. Websites like Udemy, Khan Academy, Coursera, cybrary, and many free videos are also available on youtube.</p>
            </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Hope it would help you to choose a better career for yourself.</p>
