            <p><b>India is fighting this war on many fronts not only to save human lives but also to maintain the economy of the country.</b></p>
            <p>As per the speech given by prime minister Narendra Modi dated 12th May 2020, Lockdown 4 will start from 18th May 2020 with some new rules and regulations which will be updated soon. PM Modi started his speech by giving sympathy and condolences to the families who have lost their loved ones. After that, he requests Indian citizens to be more resolute as this one virus has wreak havoc in the world and the whole world is occupied in the war of saving lives. At times like these, one's resoluteness should be bigger than the crisis. He adds that India is producing around 2.5 lakh PPE kits and N95 masks everyday as compared to the zero counts of both before this corona crisis. PM Modi describes India as a self-reliant country as the world's perspective of self-reliance has changed from an economy based on human-based globalization, India's culture and traditions speak volumes about self-reliance. He also talked about Atamanirbharta (self-reliance) package, he told that we can only achieve atamanirbharta by Atma vishvas(self-confidence) and Atma ball (self-power).</p>
            
            <p>
              He gave the five pillars for self-reliance as:
              <ol>
                <li>Economy</li>
                <li>Infrastructure</li>
                <li>Technologically driven systems</li>
                <li>Demography</li>
                <li>Demand</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            
            <p>And to achieve this Land, Labour, Liquidity and Laws [The four L's] have been taken into account. With the Atamanirbharta package, India's total economic package to deal with the aftermath of COVID 19 stands at 20 lakh crore. It is almost 10% of India's GDP. With this said he also urged the population of India to focus on local products, PM Modi added Indian people should be Vocal about Local. People should not only buy local products but also market it in Indian as well as the global market also. To end the speech he said that Lockdown 4 will be completely different from the other three lockdown and the people of India will be notified about it mostly before 18th May.</p>
            <p>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city of China and has since spread globally, resulting in an ongoing pandemic. Common symptoms of this disease include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.</p>
            <p>On 30 January 2020, the first case of COVID-19 pandemic in India was reported. Currently, the infection rate of COVID-19 in India is reported to be around 1.7, significantly lower than in the worst affected countries. The outbreak of this pandemic started from Kerela when a student studying at the university in Wuhan, China came to visit her hometown. She tested positive for Coronavirus on 30th January 2020. In a little while, two more people found positive for COVID-19, they too were students returned for vacation. As soon as the authorities were notified about the situation, the WHO recommended contact tracing, isolation and surveillance plan was put into action overnight in Kerala. The plan relied on consulting patients, mapping their movements to see who they had interacted with, and isolating anyone in the chain with symptoms. But there was one obstacle, families were not forthcoming, they didn't want to declare the full extent of their movement as if they were embarrassed. </p>
            <p>PB Nooh, a civil servant in Kerala assembled a team to search for the families movements by using GPS data mined from families mobile phones and surveillance footage taken from the airport, streets, stores rather than wasting time asking them and in a matter of hours they got more information about their movement than they have been told. Kerela's health minister KK Shailaja had ordered Kerala’s four international airports to start screening passengers in January. All those people showing the symptoms were taken to a government facility, where they were tested and kept isolated; their samples were flown to the National Institute of Virology 700 miles away. By the month of February, she had a 24-member state response team coordinating with the police and all the public officials across Kerala. As it seems this was not enough as the casualties of this virus started increasing in other cities and districts. More than a dozen states and UTs declared this as an epidemic and provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 have been invoked, and educational institutions and many commercial establishments have been shut down also various tourist visas have been suspended.</p>

            </p>

            <p>On 19th March, The GOI started corona helpdesk on WhatsApp to spread the correct information and urged people to stop believing on any rumours. </p>
            <p>On 22nd March 2020, At the instance of PM Narendra Modi, a voluntary public curfew was observed in the country. The government of India followed it up with lockdowns in 75 districts where COVID-19 cases had occurred as well as all major cities. By this time government had already banned any travel to the affected countries and had also requested to refrain from travelling to any country. GOI was aware that there were many potential COVID positive individual that had entered the country but they had no way to trace all of their activities and movements. So, on 24 March, the prime minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population of India. </p>
            <p>Now the problem was to identify and contain the one affected by this virus, but unlike Italy, China, South Korea, there are severe limitations to India’s healthcare infrastructure, in terms of both quarantining and treatment of a large population. So India put out a strategy to identify the severe cases, what this meant was no testing unless the symptoms persist or worsens. Mass social campaigns were put out with the central message that anyone with flu symptoms ought to go on self-quarantine. And if the situation worsens they could go to the designated facilities. But there was the biggest catch, how will the people know they have been affected. This was the unknown that the government had to figure out until then the lockdown was in place, the number of treatment centres was increasing per day and the main focus was to break the chain, so as to contract the spread of the virus to the ones who are not yet affected. </p>
            <p>PM relief fund was started to collect the emergency funds required for the pandemic and it got a big response from the Indian population, donations from business tycoons as well as from the common people started flowing in. PM Modi also requested the people to install Arogya setu app so as to get updated about all the details of the COVID 19. Instead of creating medical facilities from scratch which was obviously time as well as cost consuming, the GOI started creating isolation wards by using train coaches and the best thing was it was portable, each can accommodate up to 8 beds. Supply of essential commodities like food, medicines were supplied to the poor and needy by the government authorities and the volunteers that came to help in this dire situation. Free foods and essential commodities were given to the home fewer people. Democratic India has been divided into essential and common population. The essential population includes doctors, essential medical staffs, civil service officers not only them but people on the lowest chain the workers, labourers were still working to keep the essential transportation flow as it was before this pandemic.</p>
            <p>The government was doing everything to control this unknown part. They are still figuring out the ways to control this unknown. Some measures were put into action with the help of Arogya setu app, people can check their current health status on the app by giving answers to some questions and at the same time, their location was also stored so as to know if anyone is affected or showing symptoms this app also let other users know how many people in their area have taken the test and the severity of the situation. This is one of the best measures GOI put forward. And this is the time to appreciate the IT guys who are working day and night and creating solutions like these. The use of technology has made it possible to trace, surveil and contain the infected. The 21-day lockdown was extended by 17 days till 3rd May (Lockdown 2.0) by PM Modi on his speech on 14th April. On 29th April, The Ministry of Home Affairs issued guidelines for the states to allow inter-state movement of the stranded persons. Stranded persons including migrant workers, students stranded in a different area. The nodal authorities have been told to screen every person who enters their area and put them in isolation or in-home quarantine and if there's a possibility of them getting affected, isolate them or send them to the designated facilities if the condition worsens.</p>
            <p>On 1st May, Lockdown 3.0 begun as PM Modi extends the lockdown again by 2 weeks. On 5th May, the flight plans were released for the Indian nationals stranded in other countries. For the stranded people in India, 30 trains were started from Delhi to 15 cities from 12th May.</p>
