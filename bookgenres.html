            <h4> You are wondering which book genre you should go for? What type of books you should read?. Sometimes writers also struggle how to describe their books to the readers or publisher when asked…
            </h4>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a bibliophile, you already know what genres you prefer but if you are new to reading you might be wondering what type of reader you are or which books gives you that little pleasures and you are wondering which book genre you should go for? What type of books you should read?. Sometimes writers also gets stumped and struggle how to describe their books to the readers or publisher when asked &ldquo;What genre is your book?&rdquo; So here we have curated a brief explanation of some genres you might find interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First let&rsquo;s see what are genres, some say genres are writing format. For example, it can be fiction, non fiction, poetry, play, comics or screenplay. In a nutshell genre is how a piece of writing is structured.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other definition </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">defines</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">genre&nbsp;as &ldquo;characterized by a particular style, form, or content.&rdquo; Genre is a set of expectations of what the story may be about. Narrative elements that help define a genre include: setting, writing style, characters, tropes.</span></p>
            <p><strong>Setting:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Where the story is set. Is it in past (Historical), present(current situations) or future.</span></p>
            <p><strong>Characters:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Are the characters realistic, means do they exists in our world like people, animals or things, or are they magical, or do any of them are supernatural.</span></p>
            <p><strong>Tropes:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tropes are defined as common ideas, character types, or plot elements that occur in a given genre. For example, if the story has space ships, robots, or time travel, it might be a science fiction.</span></p>
            <p><strong>Writing Style:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is where &ldquo;genre as format&rdquo; and &ldquo;genre as content&rdquo; overlap.</span></p>
            <p><strong>Types of books</strong></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All books can be broadly divided into two categories these are further divided into subcategories which is known as genres. The two main categories are Fiction and Nonfiction.</span></p>
            <p><strong>Fiction</strong></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story in fiction books are not real, they contain a made-up story &ndash; a story that did not actually happen in real life. These stories are based on sheer imagination as well as creativity of the authors and are most likely not based on facts.</span></p>
            <p><strong>Harry Potter Series</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;by J. K. Rowling, </span><strong>The song of ice and fire</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by George RR Martin are some of the examples of fiction books</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
            <p><strong>Non fiction</strong></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are opposite of fictional books, the stories are based on facts, they are happened in real life, it can be someone&rsquo;s biography.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Encyclopaedia, Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler are some examples under this category.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one more term as </span><strong>semi- fiction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these types are included in fictional category only. It is a mixture of fiction and nonfiction. These books contain factual data as well as imagination or creativity.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Image of categories]</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above image shows all different types of genres in which a book can be classified. A book can be categorised under many different genres. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example &ndash;&nbsp;Agatha Christie&rsquo;s</span><strong> Murder on The Orient Express</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can come under Mystery, Thriller, Crime and Detective as well as Realistic Fiction.</span></p>

            </p>

            <ol>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Romance</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">:&nbsp;One can say romance novels are the most popular genre&nbsp;in terms of book sales. It is most popular in the teenagers. Readers tend to be loyal to their favourite authors within the romance genre.&nbsp;Popular romance subgenres&nbsp;include paranormal romance and historical romance.</span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mystery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Mystery novels start with an exciting hook, keep readers interested with suspenseful pacing, and end with a satisfying conclusion that sometimes answers all of the reader&rsquo;s outstanding questions and sometimes make them ponder how the situation should have ended. Mystery books draw a large readership, especially if they&rsquo;re part of a larger series. Popular mystery&nbsp;subgenres include true crime novels, scientific mysteries, hardboiled detective stories, and police procedurals.</span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Fantasy and science fiction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Fantasy books often feature magical creatures, from worldly wizards to murderous zombies. They often take place in a different time period from our own. Fantasy subgenres&nbsp;include urban fantasy, steampunk, high fantasy, epic fantasy, dark fantasy, and sword and sorcery. Many sci-fi stories take place in a dystopian past or future. Most of the science fiction books are set in the future and deal with the aftermath of scientific and technological advancement but they can also have a historical setting. Meanwhile, certain fiction genres like magical realism blend the pulpy appeal of fantasy with the challenging techniques found literary fiction.&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Thrillers and horror</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Closely related to mysteries and fantasy, thrillers and horror ratchet up the suspense and shock of popular genre fiction. The bestseller list with the thriller titles are dominated by authors like Dan Brown and David Baldacci, while the contemporary horror genre is reigned by none other than Stephen King.</span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Young adult</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Young adult fiction recasts popular adult genres into books geared toward a teenage audience. From sci-fi to romance to crime books to fantasy, the best books in the YA fiction genre include the same strong characters and propulsive storylines that you&rsquo;ll find in books for older readers. J.K. Rowling has had enormous success in the YA genre with her&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;series. So has Suzanne Collins with&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hunger Games</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;R.L. Stine brings horror fiction to child and teenage audiences&nbsp;with his&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goosebumps</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear Street</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;series.</span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Children&rsquo;s fiction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Children&rsquo;s fiction is aimed at audiences too young for the young adult genre.&nbsp;Children&rsquo;s fiction&nbsp;starts with picture books for non-readers and pushes onward into short stories for early readers and middle-grade fiction. Note that a picture book is not the same as a comic book or graphic novel, both of which are intended for older audiences. The fairy tale subgenre is also part of children&rsquo;s fiction.</span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Inspirational, self-help, and religious books</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These nonfiction book genres reach massive audiences worldwide. Entrepreneurship, success in business,&nbsp; wealth acquisition are some self-help books that moany people read. Most of the self help books titles in the religious category incorporate religious doctrine. They offer suggestions for tackling real-life problems, often from a spiritual perspective.</span></li>
                <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Biography, autobiography, and memoir</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These nonfiction books tell the stories of a person&rsquo;s life. In the case of&nbsp;autobiography and memoir, the subject is the author of the book. Biographies are written by someone other than the subject themselves. These books are comprised of factual information that is traditionally buttressed by multiple sources. This makes biographies different from historical fiction, which is set during well-researched historical time periods but contains original plotlines that aren&rsquo;t based on real life</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a bookish or you like reading then you should read books in every genre, atleast one book per genre to get a hang of it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I believe it is important to have read something in most genres because they stimulate different parts of the brain. Fiction is incredibly helpful in learning empathy. Fantasy and science fiction genre requires not only learning new rules but world building and also engages creativity. Romance genre generates emotions that feels good (usually there is a happy ending albiet I find this genre to have the most consistent plot devices and tropes) and humour also which is rather obvious. Cozy mysteries do just that, but they probably aren't the most beneficial option. On to nonfiction, the obvious benefits here are actually increasing academic learning and perspective (perspective can be obtained in fiction, but I think it's more "real" with actual people, which is common sense.). But in nonfiction category we have to be very careful as "nonfiction" is often based on someone else&rsquo;s perspective so it is not completely true; most of the content is biased and often requires reading multiple perspectives to grasp a good sense of the material. Technical books don't often require that. Explorative topics like&nbsp; "how to fix our education system" or "how to improve yourself" type books that engage your brain to search for your own answer or truth and question the logic.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best genres for me changes for my current circumstances. For instance, when I was younger, I wanted to do more and be more. I read a lot of fantasy stories. Nowadays, I seek better understanding around me and want the foundation the others around me seem to have, so I read classics (Frankenstein right now, it's much different than movie interpretations!). When I need a break from my life, I often read manga. I like the different types of stories and different cultural experiences one can find there.</span></p>
