            <p><b>The success of Oyo can be measured by the number of Oyo boards one can see in their area.</b></p>
            <p>It has a partnership in almost all the small chain hotels providing rooms and facilities at an affordable price. The popularity of this brand has increased exponentially in the general public as whoever wants to rent a hotel, the first name that comes to mind is OYO. Wants to go somewhere need a place to crash for a night book an Oyo, already in the middle of nowhere but rest assured you will find an Oyo hotel for sure. So what is the secret behind this Oyo everywhere?</p>
            <p>One can say this chain has started in the year 2013, under the name of oravel. But the universe was conspiring this since 16th November 1993. The day Ritesh Agarwal was born in the business class family in Bassam Cuttack, Orissa. He was not an average kid, during his school days in Rayagada, he would screw around with his computer for fun which later made him more interested in computers and programming. Then he decided to make his career in computers. In 2009, he left for Kota to prepare for IIT, but in no time he realised that it is not the place for learning and pursuing his coding career. Still, he started attending the classes his dad got him into and after classes he used to travel and chill a lot. At the age of 16, Ritesh was one of the 240 children selected to be part of the Asian Science Camp held at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai. The camp provided a forum annually for pre-collegiate students with the sole aim of promoting discussion for the betterment of science in that region. When he was 17, Ritesh authored a best-selling book; The Encyclopaedia of Indian Engineering Colleges. His books were also one of the best sellers on Flipkart for a while. At the same age, he became the youngest chief executive officer (CEO) in India of a company called Worth Growth Partners. This also gave him some popularity in his class and enough pocket money to spend on travelling. While travelling he used to stay at some budget hotels, pgs and used to attend some business conferences, seminars. While staying at these hotels he got an idea of budget hotels since it is hard to find one and for a traveller, it seemed impossible.</p>
            <p><b>The Journey of OYO:</b></p>
            <p>In 2011, 18-year-old Ritesh, dropped out of college to chase his entrepreneurship dream and start his career in that direction. He was inspired by Airbnb's online homestay project which he named as Oravel and little did he know that it will become one of India's largest budget hotel chain. It was the aggregator of bed and breakfast stays. It was meant to be a destination for short term bed and breakfast stays, private rooms, serviced apartments. In the same year, he got funding of ₹30 lac from venture nursery. He developed a website with the help of NCrypted to kick start his idea. Later when his idea started growing he acquired the sole rights of the website.</p>
            <p>In the year 2013, Agarwal got selected in the Thiel Fellowship programme, a 2-year-old program started by the founder of Paypal which gave him funding of $100,000 to pursue his dream. Along with this he also received fundings from some angel investors and VCs. As he was the only Indian to receive the Thiel funding he started becoming popular in the market. Oyo was launched in Gurgaon.</p>
            <p>By August 2014, Oyo received its first series A funding. By now he had changed his idea from Oravel to Oyo stays-- budget hotels chain in India. He had shifted from his rented home to Oyo stays in Gurgaon, which was his base of operations. According to mint, he had already received funding of ₹4 crores from Lightspeed Venture Partners (LSVP) and DSG Consumer Partners, Singapore. When he was 20, Oyo stays received funding of $6 million from Sequoia Capital and LSVP at a pre-money valuation of $60 million.</p>

            <p>In the year 2015, Oyo launched its app. The mobile app acted as a catalyst in writing the success story of his hotel chain start-up that was to follow. It is a user-friendly app that helps customers book rooms directly. Oyo, by now had stretched its wings over Kolkata, Mumbai, Goa, Bangalore and was continuously spreading at a massive pace. It now had almost expanded to 2000 hotels, 20,000 rooms and around 100 cities in India.</p>
            <p>In July 2015, Oyo was able to bag $100 million in its Series C round of funding from Japanese investor SoftBank,  one of the most prominent and powerful investors in the world. This year proved to be a financially fulfilling year for Oyo with SoftBank having its back.</p>
            <p>In January 2016 the first month of the year itself, the hotel chain hit the 1 million check-ins mark and also made an advent outside India into the Asia Pacific market, beginning with Malaysia. With this Malaysia became the first Oyo chains of hotels outside India.</p>
            <p>In 2017- Continuing its expansion aspiration, it launched a business in Nepal. Nepal and Malaysia were just a glimpse of the monstrous development of Oyo that was to follow.</p>
            <p>It was the year 2018, in which the Oyo empire wast completely established in Asia-Pacific and it kick-started international proliferation by establishing operations in UK, UAE, Dubai, China, Singapore and Indonesia. It also became a unicorn in September when it was able to raise a funding of $800 million from SoftBank and already had raised $200 million from its existing investors.</p>
            <p>2019- With the new backing of Greenoaks, Sequoia India, Lightspeed India, Hero Enterprise and China Lodging Group as its solid group of investors, Oyo is not so far from becoming a global success story, perhaps to some extent, it is already on that path. Today Oyo has more than 330,000 rooms in 500 cities globally under its administration.</p>
            <p>In 2019, Oyo registered a revenue of USD 951 million, a 4.5 times increase on a year on year basis, as compared to USD 211 million.</p>
            <p>And Agarwal, still young and who has a long way ahead plans to make it the world’s largest oldest chain by 2023!</p>
