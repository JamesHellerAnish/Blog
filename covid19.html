            <p>COVID-19 virus is a member of a family of viruses named Coronavirus that are capable of causing respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).</p>
            <p>In 2019, a new member of the corona virus family was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that had originated in China.</p>
            <p>The virus, known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) became the cause of the infectious disease Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19 or Covid-19).</p>
            <p>The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, which resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in March 2020. </p>

            <b>Transmission:</b>
            <p>The covid-19 virus primarily spreads between people during their close contact, often through small droplets produced because of coughing or sneezing or talking.After that these droplets usually fall to the ground or stick on to surfaces rather than float in the air over long distances.Hence people may also become infected by it because of simply touching a contaminated surface and then later on touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.Researches show that the covid-19 virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread of this virus is possible even before the symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. Local transmission of this disease has also occurred in most countries across all six WHO regions. Due to this the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on 11 March 2020.</p>

            <b>Prevention:</b>
            <p>The various recommended measures issued by the WHO to prevent infection include frequently washing hands, maintaining physical/social distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), always covering your mouth while coughing and sneezing with a clean tissue or inner elbow, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of masks is also recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers. The use of mask by the general public vary from place to place, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use. This is solely because masks purchased by the public may impact availability for health care providers. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolations, and experimental measures.</p>
            <p>Everyone should try and keep a healthy lifestyle at home. You should maintain a proper balanced and healthy diet, should take sufficient sleep, try to stay active both mentally and physically, and make social contact with loved ones through the phone or internet. During these severe time children need extra love and attention from adults.</p>

            <b>Symptoms of Covid-19:</b>
            <p>The most common symptom is fever, although some older persons experience fever later in disease progression, as do some persons who have other medical conditions. In one study, only 44% of patients had fever when they presented to the hospital, but 89% went on to develop fever at some point during their hospitalization.</p>
            <p>Other common symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, fatigue, shortness of breath, sputum production, and muscle and joint pains. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have also been observed in varying percentages.</p>
            <p>Less common symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat.</p>
            <p>Various symptoms are being classified as emergency. These include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty in waking, and bluish face or lips. Immediate medical attention should be provided if these symptoms are present.</p>
            <p>In some, the COVID-19 disease may even progress the patient to suffer pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and at worst even death. In patients who develop symptoms severe in nature, time from symptom’s onset to needing mechanical ventilation is typically around seven to eight days.</p>
            <p>Loss of smell was identified as a common symptom of COVID-19 in March 2020, although perhaps not as common as initially reported. A decreased sense of smell and/or disturbances in taste have also been reported. Estimates for loss of smell range from 15% to 30%.</p>
            <p>As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person is first infected and the time he or she develops symptoms. This is called the incubation period. The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days, although 97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.</p>
            <p>There are also a minority of cases who do not develop any noticeable symptoms at any point of time. </p>
 
            <b>Treatment:</b>
            <p>There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, and no vaccine is currently available. The treatment is symptomatic, and oxygen therapy represents the major treatment intervention for patients with severe infection. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary in cases of respiratory failure refractory to oxygen therapy, whereas hemodynamic support is essential for managing septic shock. </p>
            <p>On January 28, 2020, a document was released by the World Health Organization (WHO) summarizing its recommended guidelines and scientific evidences derived from the treatment of previous epidemics from HCoVs. This document addresses measures for recognizing and sorting patients with severe acute respiratory disease; strategies for infection prevention and control; early supportive therapy and monitoring; a guideline for laboratory diagnosis; management of respiratory failure and ARDS; management of septic shock; prevention of complications; treatments; and considerations for pregnant patients.</p>
            <p>The first and basic treatment is self-care. If you even feel slightly sick you should take proper rest, drink plenty of fluid, and eat nutritious food. To prevent other family members from being infected from the covid-19 virus you should try and stay in a separate room and should use a dedicated bathroom if possible.</p>
 
            <p>Among various therapeutic strategies, systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of viral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are not recommended. Moreover, unselective or inappropriate administration of antibiotics should be avoided, although some centres recommend it. Although no antiviral treatments have been approved, several approaches have been proposed such as lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg every 12 hours), chloroquine (500 mg every 12 hours), and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg every 12 hours). Alpha-interferon (e.g., 5 million units by aerosol inhalation twice per day) is also used.</p>
